description: Should someone with Stargardt disease get genetically tested if the doctor has already diagnosed them?

Yes, definitely. It’s a one-time blood test (or sometimes even a saliva test), and once you have the information, you never have to do it again. Many specialists use it to help track your progress. Clinical trials are also underway that require a genetic test to confirm specific ABCA4 gene mutations. If one of these therapies is ever approved by the FDA or your country’s regulatory authority, they will require a blood test for treatment anyway. It’s also useful for your family; if someone else has vision issues, you can begin to map out your genetic history
