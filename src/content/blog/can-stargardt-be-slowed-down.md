Currently, there is no proven treatment to slow down Stargardt disease, but research is ongoing. The progression of the disease varies among individuals, and while there isn't a way to stop it, there are some steps that may help protect your vision:

- Sun Protection: Wearing sunglasses that block UV and blue light may help reduce potential damage from sunlight, which can be harmful to retinal cells.

- Diet and Supplements: Avoiding high doses of vitamin A, especially in supplements, is recommended, as Stargardt disease is linked to the ABCA4 gene, which affects vitamin A processing in the retina.

- Clinical Trials: Participation in clinical trials may offer access to experimental treatments that could potentially slow the disease's progression.

- Healthy Lifestyle: Maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding smoking, and managing overall health can support eye health, although it won't directly slow the disease.

It's important to stay in touch with a retinal specialist, as they can offer guidance on the latest research and potential treatments as they become available.
