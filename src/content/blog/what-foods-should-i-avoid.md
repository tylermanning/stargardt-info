Almost everything is safe to eat! The only exception is organ meats like liver, which contain very high levels of vitamin A, though most people donâ€™t eat these often anyway. Vitamin A from vegetables is fine. The most important thing to avoid is supplements or multivitamins containing vitamin A. Some ophthalmologists also recommend avoiding supplements or vitamins with vitamin E.

Eating a healthy diet overall is beneficial, as it may help you avoid the need for supplements or multivitamins. Keep in mind that in many countries, supplements are not regulated, so even if a product claims to be free of vitamin A, there's no guarantee of how it was prepared.
